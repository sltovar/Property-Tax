# Property-Tax
A Java program with user input that calculates and displays how much annual property tax a homeowner will be charged.

The program asks the user for the actual value of a piece of property and the current tax rate for each $100.00 of assessed value. The outputs diplay the property value, the assessed value, and the tax rate to two decimal places.
